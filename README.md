# Calculator-Java

This Calculator was created for my Twitch Chatbot to use. Since it is meant to be used on Twitch, the Calculator only 
accepts a string as the operation for it to process due to how the bot will read data from Twitch chat.

<br />

This Calculator only accepts "( ) + - * /" as input along with decimal numbers. It does not do other math operations 
like exponents. The input string can contain spaces or no spaces.

<br />

<pre>
Valid input is (2.2  +5)   (  9  (1  /1))
</pre>

<pre>
Invalid input is (2^3 + 4)
